# paradox

A puzzle game about avoiding your past.

Solve the puzzle once, then solve it again, but make sure you aren't seen by your past life.

Controls: WASD to move, control where you look with the mouse, press e to pick up the orb.

Bugs: To pick up the orb you need to center the screen on the orb. Fixing when I have time.

Future Goals:
More levels.
More puzzle elements.
